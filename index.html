                        I was hired into Avero at a time when the company was making the transition from outsourced to in-house engineering. I was brought on as the Director of Engineering reporting to the CTO and as the first hire in Boulder. I was tasked with building out an engineering office from scratch and taking the lead on modernizing Averoâ€™s applications.

                        <li>
                            In my first year the focus was on establishing a core group of technology leaders, understanding the business and its existing technology, and setting technical patterns and practices that would serve us well moving forward.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Hired a small group of senior engineers and worked with them to choose & build out the technology stack that we would use migrate our infrastructure to the cloud, allow our teams to progressively take ownership of business domains, and modernize our web and mobile applications - AWS, Docker, Postgres, Java, GRPC, GraphQl, Typescript, React, React-Native.

                                    Acted as team lead and individual contributor rebuilding our most strategically important application: Avero FCM, an <a target="_blank"  href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/avero-fcm-mobile/id1271409324">IOS</a> / <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fcmmobileui&hl=en_US">Android</a> mobile application which makes it easy for restaurant staff to take inventory.  In a small, expert team I took primary responsibility for requirements refinement, UI development, and UX design.

                                    Lots of interviewing and hiring! We grew to ~30 engineers in the Boulder office, with most of that hiring happening during this time period. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    With our engineering leaders, built out the organizational and technical infrastructure to support 6 teams working towards independent deliverables. This includes agile processes, repeatable build processes, architectural separation of responsibilities, organizing people and skills appropriately.

                                    Acted as manager and technical lead for Avero Logbook, our most-used product. We migrated the Logbook system off of legacy infrastructure, rebuilt the <a target="_blank" href="https://averoinc.com/logbook/">web</a> and mobile (<a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/avero-logbook/id1259702980">IOS</a> / <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logbookmobileui&hl=en_US">Android</a>) interfaces, and introduced highly requested new functionality. Slowly rolled out the new Logbook to our customers, first to opt-in beta customers and then as a progressive roll-out to our entire user base.

                                    As we reached our hiring targets, I began working more closely with the executive leadership to define strategic goals for the company that were more tightly focused and aligned to our capacity to deliver. In this process I worked to frame technical and organizational decisions in terms of tradeoffs for the business and their broader implications for our products. I also used data from our experience over the previous years - timelines for past projects, rough sizing and team velocity, retros on outcomes - to help set achievable goals and drive meaningful conversations around prioritization.

                    <p>
                        During my tenure at LogRhythm, I made the transition from an individual contributor on the Web UI team to that team's
                        technical lead and then to a principal engineer in a full-time software architecture role. Across these positions
                        I made a number of significant contributions:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            On the Web UI Team I built some of the most iconic features of the LogRhythm interface: high quality, differentiating
                            data visualizations, a customizable dashboard builder, and collapsible a palette system to organize application functionality. Emphasized delivering excellent user experience by maintaining visual context through animation, performant UI that does
                            not drop frames, and simple, intuitive workflows.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the technical lead of the WebUI team:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Led the end-to-end design and implementation of <a href="https://logrhythm.com/products/features/case-management/">LogRhythm Case Management</a> - a major new feature in LogRhythm's product suite.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Introduced process and infrastructure to better facilitate continuous integration and improve the team's ability to iterate and deliver software quickly. Examples include taking ownership and automating installer builds, introducing artifactory as a private npm registry, and moving build scripts out of Jenkins and into git to deliver repeatable builds and reduce "snowflake servers."
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As a principal engineer and software architect, I led the effort to re-architect LogRhythm's software in pursuit of better
                            stability, scalability, and quality as we move into the enterprise market.
                            <ul>

                                    Designed and documented a plan for the decomposition of monolithic services into microservices, organized around logical
                                    business domains.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Designed and implemented a system for dynamic service discovery and load balancing using consul, an API Gateway, and REST
                                    APIs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Championed APIs as first-class products, proposed specifications and standards for REST APIs, and participated in design reviews as teams began implementing their API layers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Emphasized clear, consistent communication both up to executive management and across the engineering organization. Presented regular engineering brownbags, helped to established an "Architecture Council," and pushed for greater representation of engineering needs & concerns in the organizational planning process.

                    I consider myself very lucky to have Erin as a team member. He has proven time and again to be a reliable, thorough and
    capable resource. He requires almost no direction; but, still values collaboration and feedback. ... This is a testament to his
    considerable skills; both technical and interpersonal.

                    [Erin is] a great developer and a tremendous asset to the project. He is very strong in both clientside and serverside
    programming, bringing a number of innovative concepts into the project that we simply would not have thought of without
    him ... He's also one of the few developers I've worked with that really understands 'dev ops', or all the little bits that go into
    taking a concept and turning it into a production-quality product including all the operations and maintenance
    considerations that go into it. ... There's nothing he's done for us that has been lacking by any measure.
