                    <p>
                        During my tenure at LogRhythm, I have made the transition to an individual contributor on the Web Interface team, to that
                        team's technical lead, to a principal engineer in a full-time software architecture role. Across
                        these roles, I have made a number of significant contributions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            As a member of the WebUI Team I built some of the most iconic features of the LogRhythm interace including custom-built data
                            visualizations, a dyanmic tile system for rearrangable dashboards, and a stacking palette system
                            for flexible page layouts. Throughout all of this work, there was a strong emphasis on delivering
                            excellent user experience by maintaining visual context through animation, performant ui that
                            does not drop frames, and simple, intuitive workflows.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As the lead of the WebUI team:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Led the design and implementation of the LogRhtyhm Case Management system.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Introduced processes and infrastructure to better facilitate continuous integration and improve the team's ability to iterate
                                    and deliver software more quickly. Examples include taking ownership and automating installer
                                    builds, introducing artifactory as a private npm registry, and moving build instructions
                                    out of Jenkins and into VCS to deliver repeatable builds and reduce "snowflake servers".
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As a principal engineer and software architect, I led the effort to rearchitect the LogRhythm software in pursuit of better
                            stability, scalability, and quality of software as we move into the enterprise market.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Designed and documented a plan for the decomposition of monolithic services into microservices, organized around logical
                                    business domains.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Designed and implemented a system for dyanmic service discovery and load balancing using consul, an API Gateway service,
                                    and REST APIs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Introduce a culter of APIs as products, propose specifications and standards for REST APIs, and participate in design reviews
                                    as teams began implementing their API layers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Emphasize clear, consistent communication both up to executive management and down to the engineering organization, through
                                    regular engineering brownbags, the establishment of an "Architecture Council", and pushing
                                    for greater representation of engineering needs & concerns in the organizational planning
                                    process. </li>

                            The project used node.js, socket.io and Backbone to deliver realtime chat capabilities, and Apache
