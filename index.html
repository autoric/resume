                            data visualizations, a customizable dashboard builder, and collapsible a palette system to organize application functionality. Emphasized delivering excellent user experience by maintaining visual context through animation, performant UI that does
                            not drop frames, and simple, intuitive workflows.

                                    Introduced process and infrastructure to better facilitate continuous integration and improve the team's ability to iterate and deliver software quickly. Examples include taking ownership and automating installer builds, introducing artifactory as a private npm registry, and moving build scripts out of Jenkins and into git to deliver repeatable builds and move away from "snowflake servers."

                    [Erin is] a great developer and a tremendous asset to the project. He is very strong in both clientside and serverside
    programming, bringing a number of innovative concepts into the project that we simply would not have thought of without
    him ... He's also one of the few developers I've worked with that really understands 'dev ops', or all the little bits that go into
    taking a concept and turning it into a production-quality product including all the operations and maintenance
    considerations that go into it. ... There's nothing he's done for us that has been lacking by any measure.
